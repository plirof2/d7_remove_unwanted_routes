# d7_fake_node_route
Instead of giving to the end user a shortcut type drupal.com/node/324 we can give him a bit shorter (and a bit safer ) drupal.com/f/324 . This was made because the URL aliases of some forms were so big that it was easier to just give /node/3453. To avoid this I made an alias of /node/ and named if /f/ (from form :) )
